`kotti_accounts`_ is a `Kotti`_ plugin which allows a user principal to be associated to
multiple email accounts.

For the impatient
=================

There's a demo which shows how it works.
Just run the commands below inside a clean virtualenv.

::

    git clone https://github.com/frgomes/kotti_velruse_demo.git
    cd kotti_velruse_demo
    ./run-server.sh


Setup
=====

1. Insert ``kotti_accounts.kotti_configure`` on ``kotti.configurators``

::

    kotti.configurators = kotti_velruse.kotti_configure
                          kotti_accounts.kotti_configure
                          # other plugins...

2. See also kotti_velruse_ for other configurations, since ``kotti_velruse`` and
   ``kotti_accounts`` were designed to work together.


Design Decisions
================

* associate multiple externally authenticated identities to a single Principal.

* substitute part of the internal registration workflow provided by ``kotti.security``.

* behave as a drop-in to the existing ``kotti.security`` Principals.

* all existing test cases depending on Principals must pass.

* integrate with `kotti_velruse`_ via events.


Workflow
========

New user
--------

The actions enumerated below happen when a user authenticates for the first time using
his/her external OpenID account (or any other authentication method):

- the user's real name and email address are obtained from the external provider;

- a new Principal is created and populated with the real name and email address;

- a new Account is created and populated with the email address;

- the newly created Account is associated with the newly created Principal;

- event UserSelfRegistered is triggered, in order to integrate with other plugins.

- the session is then authenticated with the allocated Principal.


Returning user
--------------

These actions enumerated below happen when a returning user authenticates:

- the user's real name and email address are obtained from the external provider;

- find the Account which matches the email address;

- finds the Principal associated with the Account;

- the session is then authenticated with the Principal found.


Add email to existing user
--------------------------

These actions enumerated below happen when new email addresses are added to an existing
Principal, using the new Preferences page:

- the user remains authenticated as he/she was, keeping the current Principal;

- the user performs a new login, authenticates against another external provider;

- the user's real name and email address are obtained from the external provider;

- a new Account is created and populated with the email address; the real name is discarded;

- the newly created Account is associated with the existing created Principal;

- the session remains authenticated as it was in the beginning.


Pending
-------

- (TODO) ability to merge accounts.


Troubleshooting
===============

How do I authenticate as administrator?
---------------------------------------

The default authentication method provided by Kotti retrieves Principals from the database
and compares the password you type against what is stored there. The authentication method
provided by ``kotti_accounts`` relies on authentication performed by external providers,
which means that the usual ``admin/qwerty`` is not valid anymore.

The way to become administrator consists on these steps:

- Please follow the steps as described in section _Setup_, above.

- Start the server and authenticate using some external provider of your preference.

- Stop the server

- Temporarily comment out the configuration you've done.

- Start the server again and authenticate this time as "admin/qwerty", since the default
  authentication process will be back on.

- Enter page ``@@users`` and assing Admin rights to your user account (the one which you
  authenticated before, using an external provider).

- Stop the server

- Put the configurations back on, as explained by section Setup.

When you login to your previously created user account, using an external provider, you
will be recognized as administrator.
